# Jipoteze
## Summary
A simple HTML/CSS/JS website using the GMaps JS API and accessing an Oracle Cloud ATP DB through a REST API.

## About
This website was developed as a project for a web development class. The project required the use of data in JSON format, an API, and an attractive, responsive design. The theme of the site was a place that is familiar to you. I chose my home country, Kenya. "Jipoteze" is a Kiswahili word meaning to lose yourself. I found it fitting for the beginnings of a site that could serve as a guide to folks who would be curious to lose themselves in Kenya and share their own experiences of the place.
